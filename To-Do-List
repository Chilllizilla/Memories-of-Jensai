Jacky: 

1) research: What type of clothes should the character wear at the start? 
	description: Should it be underwear? Already some sort of Armor, if yes why? 
	Is the starting clothing the clothes you have underneath the later clothes, or just exchanged? 

2) research / small drawing task: Eyes and Hair for Characters.
  	description: Research Ideas for Eye shapes/ Colour patterns. There are multiple ways of drawing eyes, diffrent forms of pupils, size
  	and more, including eyebrows. I am also looking into the direction of "anime"-style eyes, but also more serious ones.  
  	What type of Hair would make sense in the game? Hair with flowers in it? Or shaped like roots?  
  	Ideas can be drawn, but don`t have to. Pictures of other peoples creation are fine as well. 
  
3) research: Basically almost anything about GUIs. What kind of colours/design are good. 
	How and where should the GUI elements be placed? We had the talk about synapses. Which I liked. 
	Maybe approch with some learning algorithm? Elements that are used more recently are bigger, than others? Or diffrent colours? 
	How is the overall GUI presented. Above the head of the character?   
	How viable is that thought? (Maybe look at the Sherlock Holmes games as examples of that sort of GUI)
