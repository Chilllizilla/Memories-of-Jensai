Jacky: 

1) research: What type of clothes should the character wear at the start? 
  description: Should it be underwear? Already some sort of Armor, if yes why? 
  Is the starting clothing the clothes you have underneath the later clothes, or just exchanged? 

2) research / small drawing task: Eyes and Hair for Characters.
  description: Research Ideas for Eye shapes/ Colour patterns. There are multiple ways of drawing eyes, diffrent forms of pupils, size
  and more, including eyebrows. I am also looking into the direction of "anime"-style eyes, but also more serious ones.  
  What type of Hair would make sense in the game? Hair with flowers in it? Or shaped like roots?  
  Ideas can be drawn, but don`t have to. Pictures of other peoples creation are fine as well. 
  
3) find out how github works
